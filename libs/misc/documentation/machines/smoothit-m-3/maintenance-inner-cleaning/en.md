- protection sleeves,
- goggles.

Caches needed to make the full replacement:

| Cache | Type | Reference | Amount |

| Cuve liner | Cardboard | SMT-CA-LN | 1 |
| UV lamp cache | Thermoformed | SMT-CA-UV | 1 |
| Nozzle cache | Thermformed | SMT-CA-NZ | 2 |
| Filtration inlet cache | Thermoformed | SMT-CA-LN | 1 |
| Cuve bottom | Cardboard | SMT-CA-BT | 1 |
| Cover top | Cardboard | SMT-CA-CV | 1 |
| Cover ferrule | Cardboard |Â SMT-CA-FR | 1 |

#### Liner removal

First of all, you need to unscrew the filtration inlet cache with an `2.5mm hex screwdriver`

Once the filtration inlet cache is removed, you can slide out the main cardboard liner.

Now you can remove the pulverization nozzles thermoformed caches.

Always remove left over varnish using a towel with some IPA on it.

> This operation must be repeated for the low nozzle cache.

The same goes for the UV Lamp cache, it is maintained by 2 double sided tape stripes on the sides of the cache.

You then have to clean the UV Lamp glass using a towel and some IPA.

#### Magnetic bottom cache swap

Get the magnetic bottom cache out of its place by sliding the cardboard over the central pole.

![Sliding out the magnetic bottom](slide_out_magnetic_bottom.png)

Remove the cardboard from the magnetic support

Using a paper towel and some IPA, clean up the cuve bottom.

![Cleaning cuve bottom](clean_cuve_bottom.png)

Place back the magnetic support

![Placing back the magnetic support](place_magnetic_support.png)

Place back the cardboard bottom cache `SMT-CA-BT`. Be sure to clip the cardboard using the 4 pins of the magnetic support.

![Placing back the cardboard](place_bottom_cardboard.png)

The cuve bottom should now look like this.

#### Cover caches replacement

The cover ferrule `SMT-CA-FR` is maintained in a 3mm groove. The ferrule must be slided in the groove to stay in place.

![Sliding the ferrule in the groove](slide_cover_ferrule.png)

Attach ferrule ends with a some paper tape. The prevents the ferrule to fall down.

The cover main cache `SMT-CA-CV` is maintained by 4 double sided tape bands. Remove the double sided adhesive protection and place the cover cache.

![Placing the cover cache](place_cover_cache.png)

The cover should now look like this.

#### Liner replacement

In order to place the cardboard liner, you will need to place the thermoformed caches before anything else.

Place the nozzle thermoformed caches (`SMT-CA-NZ`).

![Placing nozzle thermoformed caches](place_nozzle_caches.png)

Theses caches must follow the cuve radius.

![Placed nozzle caches](placed_nozzle_caches.png)

For the UV Lamp cache (`SMT-CA-UV`), be careful about the slot. It must be located on the left.

![UV Lamp cache slot side](uvlamp_slot_side.png)

The cache is maintained in place using 2 stripes of double sided tape on each side.

![Placing the UV lamp cache](place_uvlamp_cache.png)

Apply a small pressure on the double sided tape to make sure that the cache should not be able to move.

![Applying pressure on the cache](pressure_uvlamp_cache.png)

You will now need to place the liner `SMT-CA-LN` inside the cuve,

![Place liner inside the cuve](place_liner.png)

Slide the left side into the cache holder

![Slide liner inside holder on the left](slide_liner_left.png)

Slide the right side into the cache holder

![Slide liner inside holder on the right](slide_liner_right.png)

Make sure that the liner is aligned to the top of the cuve it must not fall down.
The liner placement should look like this.

You will then need to replace the filtration inlet cache `SMT-CA-NL`

![Filtration inlet cache placement](place_filtration_inlet_cache.png)

This cache must follow the cuve radius
