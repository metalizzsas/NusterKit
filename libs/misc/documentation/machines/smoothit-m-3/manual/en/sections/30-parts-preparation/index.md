## Parts preparation

Parts post-processed with the Smoothit machine must first go under a set of preparation steps to ensure a successful coating. Throughout the preparation stages and during the process, make sure you handle the parts with **gloves** to avoid surface contamination.

The initial surface condition affects the quality of the varnish deposit. A polluted, undegreased or unpolymerized surface will lead to varnish defects (poor adherence, nodules, etc.).

Follow these key steps to improve the result givent by your Smoothit.

### Sandblasting

Follow the table to get the sandblasting parameters for the material you wish deposit on

| Material | Sanding pressure | Sandblasting media |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Polyjet | 0.6 MPa | Corindon 180 |
| SLA / DLP | 0.25 MPa | Corindon 180 |

> After sandblasting, make sure to remove all the remaining sand off the part by blowing pressurized air on the part.

### Washing & Rinsing

We recommand to wash your part using degreasant with an ultrasonic bath. Degrasing removes all the hydrophobic molecules.

Then rinse your parts using clean deionized water in a ultrasonic bath. The rinsing step is mandatory to remove any remaining degreaser on the part.

> To have an efficient, adapted on polymer parts, you can use an USCleaner. Get additional informations on [www.metalizz.com](https://www.metalizz.com/solutions-metallisation/uscleaner/)

### Checking

Make sure the parts do not have remaining dust after the Washing / Rinsing step.

### Drying

You need to dry your parts using a drying oven, parts with remaining water will not get post-processed correctly.

### Surface activation *(Optional)*

If the surface adhesion must meet some requirements, you can use:

- Flame treatment
- Plasma
- Corona

These surface activations techniques might require additional care about your parts.

## Placing parts in the support

To be post-processed with your Smoothit machine, your parts must be attached to the Smoothit HPAD part handling system.

Each part must be not too close from each-other, we recommend a 15-20mm space between parts.

Use the provided supports to attach parts into the support.

| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Grippers Rake | Grippers Screw M3 x 10 | Grippers Screw M4 x 16 |

For the **Grippers Rake**, you can add springs to maintain your parts using springs. Push the springs on top of the pins to attach them on the Rake gripper.

Each gripper can be attached to the inner frame using `HPAx-Fix` small parts. They can be attached to the frame using an M3 Screw.

You can now place your part using a gripper inside the `HPAx-Fix` part.

Your are now ready to go !
