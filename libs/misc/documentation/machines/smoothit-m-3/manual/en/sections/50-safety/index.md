## Verification of safety conditions

### Pre-cycle check

Before using your Smoothit, make sure it is working properly.

Perform a general check following the steps below to validate all safety conditions.

To check the Smoothit's safety conditions, click on "Cycle".

Then click on the cycle button of your choice.

Before starting a cycle, the screen displays the safety conditions. If one or more indicators are red, the "Start cycle" button is red and cannot be activated. It will turn green when all indicators are also green.

### Safety conditions

#### Emergency stop

When the "Emergency stop button" safety indicator is red, it means that the button is engaged.

To disengage the emergency stop button, turn it clockwise.

It is located on the front of the Smoothit.

#### Nitrogen pressure too low

When the "Nitrogen pressure too low" safety indicator is red, this means that the Smoothit is not correctly supplied with compressed nitrogen.

#### Lid

To close the tanks, close the lid when you hear a `click` it is properly closed.
The presense sensor will light up.

#### Varnish container

Checks if there is a varnish bottle. It might be not correct if the bottle is not screwed to the end.

#### UV lamp overheat

Checks if the UV lamp has reached its overheat protection.

#### Activated carbon filter cartridge

We recommend changing the activated carbon filter cartridge every 75 cycles.

>**Please note**: Used activated carbon must be disposed of in an approved waste disposal facility (European waste code 06 13 02* in accordance with Directive (EU) 2008/98/EC).
