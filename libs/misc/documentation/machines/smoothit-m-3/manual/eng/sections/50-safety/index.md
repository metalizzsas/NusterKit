## Verification of safety conditions
### Pre-cycle check

Before using your Metalfog, make sure it is working properly.

Perform a general check following the steps below to validate all safety conditions.

To check the Metalfog's safety conditions, click on "Cycle".

Then click on the cycle button of your choice.

Before starting a cycle, the screen displays the safety conditions. If one or more indicators are red, the "Start cycle" button is red and cannot be activated. It will turn green when all indicators are also green.

### Safety conditions
#### Emergency stop

When the "Emergency stop button" safety indicator is red, it means that the button is engaged.

To disengage the emergency stop button, turn it clockwise.

It is located on the front of the Metalfog.

#### Lid

To close the tank, slide the lid between the rubber seal and the two side runners. Check that it stops and that the presence sensor at the top of the tank at the rear of the machine lights up.

When the "lid sensor" safety indicator is red, this means that the lid is not fitted or is incorrectly positioned.

#### Effluent containers

When the "Effluent container presence sensor" safety indicator is red, this means that the container is missing or incorrectly positioned.

Before starting a cycle, it is essential to ensure that the effluent container is inside the machine ( left-hand side) and correctly positioned.

>**Caution** : The effluent generated when using the Metalfog must be collected and treated in the appropriate process. The European code determined by Directive (EU) 2008/98/EC for this type of waste is: 09 01 06*, corresponding to "silver-containing waste from in-situ processing of photographic waste - Alkaline liquid effluent pH 10".

#### Pressurized air

When the "Air pressure sensor" safety indicator is red, this means that the Metalfog is not correctly supplied with compressed air.

#### Activated carbon filter cartridge

We recommend changing the activated carbon filter cartridge every 50 cycles. 

>**Please note**: Used activated carbon must be disposed of in an approved waste disposal facility (European waste code 06 13 02* in accordance with Directive (EU) 2008/98/EC).
